# Calculator

## About
This is a GUI calculator I created using Python 3 and tkinter as part of an NCEA Level 3 assessment in 2015.

## Pre-requsisites
Install Python 3 and tkinter using `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`

## Running the program
Run the command `python3 calculator.py`

## Using the calculator
It is pretty simple to use the calculator, similar to most simple (i.e., not scientific) calculators, with some limitations (see below). Note that error messages will print to the terminal.

### Limitiations
* You can only use one operator per calcuation.
* After completing a calculation, to make another, you have to either press the CE button, or press the backspace (`<-`) button to remove the equals sign and the result.
